/**
 * Term Board — loader
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Paste this ONCE. It fetches the real script from the repo and runs it, so
 * changes reach the phone without copying seven hundred lines across again.
 *
 * The last good copy is cached on the device, so this still works on a plane or
 * when GitHub is down — it only goes to the network to look for something newer.
 *
 * THE TRADE: this executes code fetched from the internet at run time. That is
 * fine here because it is your own repository and you control what lands in it,
 * but it does mean anyone who could push to that repo could run code on your
 * phone. If you would rather not accept that, don't use this file — paste
 * TermBoard.js directly instead. It is the same script; this one just saves the
 * copying.
 *
 * SETUP
 *   1. Scriptable → + → paste this file → name it "Term Board".
 *   2. Run it once. It downloads the real script and caches it.
 *   3. Home screen → add a Scriptable widget (Large) → pick this script.
 *      Set "When Interacting" to "Run Script".
