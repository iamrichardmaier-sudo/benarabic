/**
 * Publish the board as static files inside the benarabic repo, so GitHub Pages
 * serves it at a real URL:
 *
 *   https://iamrichardmaier-sudo.github.io/benarabic/term-board/
 *   https://iamrichardmaier-sudo.github.io/benarabic/term-board/board.json
 *
 * This is what lets the Scriptable widget just fetch its data. The Claude
 * artifact could never do that job — artifact URLs need a login, so a widget
 * request gets the app shell or a 403, never the board.
 *
 * GRADES ARE WITHHELD BY DEFAULT. Pages is public, and this repository is
 * public, so anything written here is on the open internet and indexable.
 * Assignment titles and due dates are syllabus information and go out; scores
 * do not. The widget reads those from Supabase instead, signed in as Richard.
 * Pass { publishGrades: true } if you decide otherwise — see README.
